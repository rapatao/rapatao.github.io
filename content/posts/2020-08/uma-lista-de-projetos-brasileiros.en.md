Every developer, at least once, must have come across **awesome lists** calls. These lists try to bring together in one place projects related to a theme or libraries for which they were developed.

Some examples of these lists are:

- [awesome-java](https://github.com/java-lang/awesome-java)
- [awesome-python](https://github.com/vinta/awesome-python)
- [vertx-awesome](https://github.com/vert-x3/vertx-awesome)
- [awesome-javascript](https://github.com/sorrycc/awesome-javascript)
- [awesome-go](https://github.com/avelino/awesome-go)

There are several other lists of this type, just search on GitHub and you will probably find one related to the topic you want. [See several lists here](https://github.com/topics/awesome).

These lists are very useful and serve as a basis for us to find solutions and tools to solve possible problems that we are facing or simply to facilitate some of our daily activities.

[Claudison, o Filho da Nuvem](https://twitter.com/filhodanuvem) introduced me to the repository of [Felipe Fialho](https://twitter.com/felipefialho_) with the purpose of grouping Brazilian projects.

- See the list: [awesome-made-by-brazilians](https://github.com/felipefialho/awesome-made-by-brazilians)

Here is my invitation, if you know Brazilian projects and believe that they deserve to be highlighted, feel free to open your *PR* in Felipe's repository, I believe he won't mind it!

> Edit: I had created a repository for this purpose, but there is no reason to have two lists with the same purpose! Let's collaborate with what already exists!
