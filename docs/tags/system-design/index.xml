Consistency In the context of the CAP theorem, consistency means that every read operation receives the most recent write or an error. All database nodes will hold the same data at the same time.
Availability Availability means that each request made to the system either receives a valid response or error, regardless of the state of the system.</description></item></channel></rss>
