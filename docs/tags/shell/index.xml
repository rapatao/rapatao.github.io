These settings are normally kept in files, and when this user changes their environment, they sometimes make a copy of these files to the new environment. This process tends to be done by copying your files from one environment to another.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Although it works, there is a more practical way to manage these files, making the proper associations as needed, including supporting different profiles. That is, it is possible to create a &lt;em>dotfile&lt;/em> with different profiles, defining different settings according to your needs. An example of this use would be to build a profile for your personal environment, another for your professional environment, changing server access keys and &lt;em>commits&lt;/em> signature settings in &lt;em>git&lt;/em>.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
