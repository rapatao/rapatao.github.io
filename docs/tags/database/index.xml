Consistency In the context of the CAP theorem, consistency means that every read operation receives the most recent write or an error. All database nodes will hold the same data at the same time.
Availability Availability means that each request made to the system either receives a valid response or error, regardless of the state of the system.</description></item><item><title>ACID Transactions</title><link>https://www.rapatao.com/posts/2020-08/acid-transactions/</link><pubDate>Tue, 18 Aug 2020 22:00:00 -0300</pubDate><guid>https://www.rapatao.com/posts/2020-08/acid-transactions/</guid><description>ACID transactions Acronym for Atomicity, Cconsistency, Iinsulation and Durability is a set of properties of a database transaction that aim to ensure data integrity and validity, even after systemic failures or electrical power failures.
Atomicity It treats as a unit, all operations performed for a task, that is, all instructions will be successfully carried out or, none of them should be carried out. For example, in a bank transfer, in case of failure in any of the steps, the entire process must be undone and the values returned to the original.</description></item></channel></rss>
