&lt;p>You probably thought that this annotation is for building tests, but do you know what it represents, what happens when it is used?&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Reactive programming with Spring WebFlux, should I use it?</title><link>https://www.rapatao.com/posts/2020-07/should-i-use-spring-webflux/</link><pubDate>Sun, 26 Jul 2020 19:33:23 -0300</pubDate><guid>https://www.rapatao.com/posts/2020-07/should-i-use-spring-webflux/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;strong>Should I use it?&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code>No, but maybe so!
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>I could stop the article here, but that wouldn&amp;rsquo;t add anything and you would never understand why I start the text with a &lt;strong>no, but it may be yes&lt;/strong>. The truth is, if you hope to use &lt;em>WebFlux&lt;/em> and solve all your problems, I&amp;rsquo;m sorry to tell you that your problems may be just beginning.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Recently the subject &lt;em>Advantages and Disadvantages about WebFlux&lt;/em> came up in my work and because I have little experience using &lt;em>WebFlux&lt;/em>, I decided to seek more information on the subject and I intend to describe here my opinion about the use of &lt;em>WebFlux&lt;/em> and, consequently, a little about reactive programming.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
