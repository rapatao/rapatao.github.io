You probably thought that this annotation is for building tests, but do you know what it represents, what happens when it is used?</description></item><item><title>Reactive programming with Spring WebFlux, should I use it?</title><link>https://www.rapatao.com/posts/2020-07/should-i-use-spring-webflux/</link><pubDate>Sun, 26 Jul 2020 19:33:23 -0300</pubDate><guid>https://www.rapatao.com/posts/2020-07/should-i-use-spring-webflux/</guid><description>Should I use it?
No, but maybe so! I could stop the article here, but that wouldn&amp;rsquo;t add anything and you would never understand why I start the text with a no, but it may be yes. The truth is, if you hope to use WebFlux and solve all your problems, I&amp;rsquo;m sorry to tell you that your problems may be just beginning.
Recently the subject Advantages and Disadvantages about WebFlux came up in my work and because I have little experience using WebFlux, I decided to seek more information on the subject and I intend to describe here my opinion about the use of WebFlux and, consequently, a little about reactive programming.</description></item></channel></rss>
